yuicompressor-server
====================

A pure java HTTP service with an embeded yuicompressor engine

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kpacha/yuicompressor-server.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kpacha/yuicompressor-server)

Powered by [jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) and [yui-compressor](http://yui.github.com/yuicompressor/) and inspired on [fotonaut's yuicompressor-server](https://github.com/fotonauts/yuicompressor-server/)

#Requirements

* git
* jdk 1.7
* mvn 3

#Install

Clone the project and install it!

	$ git clone https://github.com/kpacha/yuicompressor-server.git
	$ cd yuicompressor-server
	$ mvn install

And, after testing the code, the yuicompressor-server.jar should be on your local maven repo

#Run with maven

	$ mvn clean compile exec:java

#Build and Run the fat-jar

	$ mvn clean compile assembly:single
	# ...and you are ready for deploy the fat-jar!

	# start your yuicompressor service
	$ java -jar target/yuicompressor-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar [<PORT> [<ALGORITHM>]]

Note the optional arguments!

* `PORT` allows you to set the service port. Default value is `8080`
* `ALGORITHM` allows you to set the hashing algorithm. Default: `SHA-1`

#Usage

Just send your javascript and css files as a post request to your service.

Simple demo with curl:

	$ curl -H "Content-Type:text/css; charset=utf-8" -X POST -id 'a {}       c{ color=red;      }' http://localhost:8080/
	# or
	$ curl -H "Content-Type:text/css; charset=utf-8" -X POST -id @src/test/resources/test.css http://localhost:8080/

Do not forget to set the `Content-Type` header with the right charset or get ready to die a painful, lonely death!

#Why?

Supose you have several hosts where you have to compress your javascript and css files. Why would you spend so much time doing the same operation again and again? And are your files different from one host to another or are they almost the same? Just take the DRY pattern to the next abstraction level and delegate that process to a dedicated service!

	$ ab -c 100 -n 1000 -H "Content-Type:text/css; charset=utf-8" -p src/test/resources/test.css -T "text/css" http://localhost:8080/
